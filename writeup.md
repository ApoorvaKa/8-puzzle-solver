## Running the solver

1. Download 8_puzzle_solver.py
2. Place it in a directory with the formatted input text files containing the 8 puzzles that are being solved. It is set up to automatically run the following three puzzles. (This can be changed by altering the main function of the code)

    - Input1.txt
    - Input2.txt
    - Input3.txt

3. Open your shell in the directory with all files.

4. Run the following command in the shell using Python 3. An example is shown below.

    `python3 8_puzzle_solver_draft.py`

5. Files containing the solutions will be generated as follows. Where `#` will be the number of the input passed to the program. The `h1` shows that the *sum of Manhattan distances of the tiles from their goal positions* was used as the heuristic and `h2` shows that *Nilsson's sequence score* was used as the heuristic.
    - Output`#`h1.txt
    - Output`#`h2.txt
